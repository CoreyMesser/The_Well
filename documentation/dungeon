basic commands

look - 		general description (also used when you move)
search - 	dc, based off serach skill to reveal items/objects/secrets if applicable
			- each time you fail a search the dc goes up by a set amount
use - 		will use an object nearby that you are facing, if an item is stated after use, the item will be used
			- use torch
take - 		picks up object/item
compass - 	you are facing N/S/E/W
turn L/R or 
	N/S/E/W - N is incremental in the poitive on y, South is negative on y, E is positive on x, W is negative on x
move - 		increment in a direction 
			- move turn - combination move, move E 1 will turn the PC E and move them 1 step
inventory 	- lists inventory 
equip **kwargs - equips item to hand/finger/etc
unequip **kwargs - unequips item and returns it to inventory


canned responses based on your surroundings
- you are facing a wall, to the N is ~ to the S is ~

- "You are facing {determined on the direction you were moving}, {nearest, free move working counter clockwise}, {secondary free move cc}, {} "


starting at 1, 1, 1
PC >>>look
"you see a wall before you a hall way leading east with an imediate corner going North"
PC >>> turn E
increment is now based on x+
"you turn East"
PC >>> move 1
increment x += 1
1, 2, 1
"you are facing a wall, to the N is a short hallway. to the West is the hall way from which you came."
PC >>> move 1
collision detection, can no longer move east
"you stop before you head into a wall"
PC >>> turn N
increment on y+
"you turn N, there is a short hallway with a corner headed east"
PC >>> move 1
increment y += 1
1, 2, 2
"you are facing a wall, to the E is a short hall that turns N"
PC >>> move E 1
increment on x+
increment x += 1

"you are facing a wall, to the N is a long dark hallway."
PC >>> move N 2
increment on y+

"you stand in a dark hallway that continues to the N"

"set into the west wall is a cold torch"
PC >>> take torch
turns PC W
increment on x-
"the torch is stuck"
PC >>> take torch
"the torch comes loose and the torch ring falls from the wall with a clatter and grinding of stone.  Before you a doorway opens in the dark hall, beyond is pitch black."
PC >>> use torch
torch is equipped and lit
"the opening before you leads into a small room dense with cobwebs"
PC >>> move W 1
increments x -= 1

"the cobwebs part before you and smolder in the flame of your torch revealing a small room that once held a small armory that has long ago rotted and rusted to junk."

"under a table long ago rotted and sagged into a formless heap you spot the glint of something that escaped the forgotten decades"
PC >>> search table
"you clear the rotted wood away to refeal a small chest made of a dull but untarnished metal."
PC >>> search chest

PC >>> take chest
"The chest will not fit in your pack but you can carry it under one arm. Will you un-equip/drop L-Hand: {item1} or R-Hand: {item2}" (dagger, torch)
