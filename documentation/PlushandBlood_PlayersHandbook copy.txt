Plush and Blood: 
The Players Handbook

Foreword:

The Plush and Blood Roleplaying system was designed around two core concepts, story telling and minimal use of dice.  Originally it was created to be used within a forum or chat and therefore put aside dice in favor of a simple numbers system.  Any RP’r out there reading this is right about now tallying up how they can manipulate and twink the system.  That is not the purpose of the PB:RP.  The purpose of the PB:RP is to play a character within a well constructed story.  Abuse and manipulation of the system is a sign of a player that is not mature enough to put aside their ego and allow themselves to be absorbed into the world for good or bad.  The point here is not get the best rolls, the highest stat or the most powerful character.  The point here is to play. 

Storytelling is a key feature and GM’s should be ready for the players to wreck all sorts of mischief within their well-outlined story.  I for one speaking as a seasoned GM can tell you that no matter how well the story is planned ahead of time the players will almost certainly derail the train, set fire to it and kill themselves in a cave-in... When all they needed to do was follow the tracks.  GM’s should be quick of wit and mighty in their imagination.  

Players should respect the story for the most part but at the same time play their characters.  Mary-sue and God-mode are not RP. Being cool, dark, and edged with angst are not RP. We’d all love to run around in black leather, high kicking light switches, and shooting flies from the air, but we are not our characters.  A mature player should play their character with conviction no matter their own personal feelings.  A Lawful Good character should NEVER agree with a Lawful Evil one.  A character with an INT of 2 cannot figure out the trap even though it is clear to you.  A character of low CHA is never going to woo.  A character with the Blind FLAW is surely going to infuriate the GM…

Whether you are a Player or a GM the main goal is to have fun.  Enjoy the story, enjoy the actions that cause it to develop down paths never considered, enjoy the relationships built within and without. 

And as I have always said, a GM will never kill their players, but will allow the players to kill themselves. When I ask you “Are you sure?” this is a non too subtle hint that you may want to think on your actions one more time.  Doesn’t mean that you are wrong, but those words are a reprise.

You are stuffed animals in a world on the brink of collapse.  Whether you live in Utopia, serve the Broken Circle, fight to remain free, prowl the wastes, or are just trying to survive, always remember who you are.

Welcome to Plush and Blood.

CHARACTER CREATION pt02

Each player starts with 42 points. As they progress through the game they will earn more points to put into various stats/skills.  There is no traditional level system, rather as each session comes to a close (or whenever the GM decides) points will be distributed to the players.  The player can then spend these points on their characters to enhance skills, stats, or in cases the GM deems acceptable, purchase MERITS.

NAME Your name, everyone needs a name.  This is what the people will shout when they parade you through the streets or tighten the noose about your neck.  This is what the sisters fame and infamy crave to spread about the world.  This is what was cried out as you drew your first breath and what will be chiseled in silence upon the stones that mark your death.  Names are not frivolous matters, names are powerful things, names will live on long past the body that gave it life.  Names are immortal.

SPECIES
Birds of a feather, stripes and spots, short faced or long there is something to be said about one’s species.  One can lambast the stereotypes labeled upon the fangs and claws of some or chastise the typecast fallacy of the meek in others. Suffice to say every species comes with its benefits and its baggage. 

SEX
Do you have a bill and two bits, or a wallet?  We could go into the whole gender identity thing but really that is better left for your long character description.

FACTION
 With The Unstuffed there are the two obvious factions involved, The Broken Circle and the Rebels of the Renewed Circle. The Broken Circle consists of Brown and his Utopia whereas the Rebels consist of Cromwell and his underground. These however are not the only two factions in this world. There are many to side with. Certain bonuses are granted with being part of a Faction.
 -THE UNSTUFFED BROKEN CIRCLE – President Brown RENEWED CIRCLE - Rebels (Cromwell pre fall of New Camelot) UTOPIAN - Civilian (most of them under Brown) KINGS OF THE LAND - Disbanded THE MEEK - Disbanded NIGHT MARKET - Underground/Black Market INVISIBLE BLADE - Assassins Guild LIBERATI ARCANUM - Mages Guild (very rare not available for campaign) KEEPERS OF KNOWLEDGE - Historians Guild/Archeologists/Scholars (neutral) DEVIL’S HANDS - (non playable)

ALIGNMENT
 The fundamental question, good, evil, neutral. There are nine classical Alignments to choose from to fit your character.  Lawful Good - Will never do wrong, the good guy, incorruptible (Police). Neutral Good - The good guy, always tries to do what's right (Typical Hero). Chaotic Good - Will do anything in the name of good (Rebel)  Lawful Neutral – Order beyond concepts of good and evil (Judge). True Neutral – Impartial observer of the world. Chaotic Neutral - Follows his own heart, shirks rules and traditions, free spirit.  Lawful Evil - Evil with a set code, idealistic (Dictator). Neutral Evil - Neither bound by any sort of honor or tradition nor disorganized and pointlessly violent (Mercenary). Chaotic Evil - Evil for evils sake, crazy and will go out of their way to torture and maim (Psychopath) 
OCCUPATIONS
 You can have a total of two Primary Occupational Character Classes (POCC). The first POCC you get for free during character creation. The Second POCC costs 10 points and can be obtained at any time past level 5. It is up to the GM as to whether or not you may purchase your second Primary. With each Occupation you can choose a Specialist Occupational Character Class (SOCC), which will give you a certain bonuses pertaining to the occupation. Each specialty costs an additional 5 points. During character creation you are limited to one SOCC per primary. During gameplay you may buy additional SOCC's at the GMs discretion. 
 The POCC gives you a permanent stat bonus that you may add immediately to your character sheet.   The SOCC gives you a check bonus. Each time a check comes up with the particular skill you may use the bonus listed in your SOCC. This is only a bonus to your checks. 
 HP a.k.a HEALTH
 This is generated primarily by your Con score. Your Health starts off as a direct copy of your Con score. 3 Con = 3 Health. This can be raised by various merits/skills or by spending extra points to raise your health. Each HP costs 4 points. 
 The maximum HP achievable is 10, if you purchase anything over the max it becomes a marker. Once you have three health markers you are considered to have gained 1 natural SOAK. For every three markers after that you gain 1 additional natural SOAK up to a MAX of 3. Markers do not count as health. Natural SOAK stacks with Armor SOAK.  STUFFING
 This is the thing that keeps you what you are. The end all of your life force. Your HP can be reduced to 0 and if you have enough STUFFING you may be brought back to life. A Plush starts out with 10 STUFFING points. Every 10 years (after the age of 10) they lose 1 point. If your HP is reduced to 0 you lose 1 point. If you are grievously wounded (missing limb, shotgun blast, bomb) you lose 1 point. STUFFING points cannot normally be restored. If your STUFFING is reduced to 5, you will lose a major STAT point and 1 HP. If your STUFFING is reduced to 3, you will lose an additional stat point and HP. If your STUFFING falls to 0 your character is nothing more then a pile of tattered rags. There are only a few Master Weavers that can restore one or two STUFFING points. But they are all under Brown’s control.  
STATS  STR= 	Strength - Your physical prowess DEX= 	Dexterity - Your nimbleness and speed CON= 	Constitution - Your Endurance INT= 	Intelligence - Your sheer knowledge WIS= 	Wisdom - Your life experiences, your judgment CHA= 	Charisma - Your look, your aura, and your silver tongue  Everyone starts with one freebie point in each stat, only by GM discretion or character specific circumstances can a STAT be 0 or negative (Players cannot recoup the cost of a STAT by lowering it at creation) (see Negative STATS). For every point you spend after correlates to the cost of the number. For example, lets say I want to raise my STR (strength),  "STR 0 - - - -"  To raise it to level 2 I need to put two points into it.  "STR 0 0 - - - "  To raise it to level 3 I need to put an additional 3 points into it.  "STR 0 0 0 - -"  So raising STR to level 3 I have now spent 5 of my total points leaving me with 37 points. This goes for All STATs and Skills. For an easy reminder here’s a table:  lv1 - 1 point (unless its a STAT then its free) lv2 - 2 points lv3 - 3 points lv4 - 4 points lv5 - 5 points  So if you want to raise on of your STAT’s up to lv5 you will need to put 14 points into it.  With a Racial Bonus, STATS are calculated like so,  Free Point + Racial Point + spent points  ex. Cat (DEX+1)  0 0 - - - DEX  Both the free point and racial point are added first, then you can spend points to raise it. A third point still costs 3, a fourth 4, and a fifth 5. So it will still cost you 12 points to raise it from lv2 to lv5 

NEGATIVE STAT  Negative stats are not the same as negative rolls/checks. Negative rolls/checks are a combination of FLAW, Situation, and GM discretion combined to push the roll’s number below 0. These rolls are devastating to the player during the round, and while they may do some lasting damage as a consequence they are not permanent and can always be fortified or redeemed. Abilities cannot be negative since they simply provide a character with training in order to boost their rolls. They will always remain at 0 if no points are added. Negative STATs however are a much more serious affair, these can be obtained through a number of ways and should be avoided at all costs (unless it is specifically part of your character). STATs can be sent into the negative through massive damage, loss of limbs/plush, terminal diseases, sever age, certain spells, and racial bonuses that are not taken into consideration during character creation.  Should you go below the base STAT there are consequences. Reducing a Base STAT to 0 will be considered a handicap and all rolls associated with said stat will be rolled at -1. Should the STAT fall below 0 into the negatives the STAT will then be considered with the following penalties.  X - - - - (-2 to rolls) X X - - - (-4 to rolls) X X X - - (-6 to rolls) X X X X - (-8 to rolls) X X X X X (-10 to rolls)  Each STAT also comes with additional penalties.  STR -1 - You are still able to move under your own power but you do so slowly and uncoordinated. You may not lift anything more than 5lbs. Movement is reduced to 5 feet per round. STR -2 - You are no longer able to stand, you are confined to a wheelchair. You may not life anything more than 1lbs. STR -3 - You are unable to lift your own limbs and suffer from partial paralysis. You are confined to a bed or motorized wheelchair. STR -4 - You are completely paralyzed. STR -5 - You cannot function without life-support.  DEX -1 - You are still able to move under your own power but you do so slowly and uncoordinated. Movement is reduced to 5 feet per round. DEX -2 - You are no longer able to stand, or gasp things with find motor control, you have terrible shakes. DEX -3 - You are no longer able to coordinate your limbs for any useful purposes, your body is racked by tremors. DEX -4 - You shake uncontrollably. DEX -5 - You cannot function without life-support.  CON -1 - You are constantly sick and take an extra point of damage when applicable. CON -2 - You can no longer exert effort to walk short distances without being winded. You have at least 1 major disease (GM discretion) that causes you to lose 2 HP a day if not medicated properly. You bruise easily and take +2dmg from even minor falls. CON -3 - You are best with coughing fits, shivering, and fevers almost constantly. You have at least 1 terminal disease (GM discretion) that causes you to lose 3 HP a day if not heavily medicated. You have bones of glass you take +3 dog from even minor falls. CON -4 - You need constant life support to survive. You lose 4 HP a day if not constantly medicated. You are most likely in a coma. CON -5 - You are dead or in a vegetative state.  INT -1 - You are no longer able to form complete sentences. You have the mentality of an 8 year old. INT -2 - You are no longer able to communicate your needs clearly. You have no short-term memory. You have light brain damage. INT -3 - You suffer from delusions and incomprehension of the world around you. You are no longer able to communicate your basic needs. You have moderate brain damage. INT -4 - You have severe brain damage. You need supervision and/or life support to survive. INT -5 - You are a vegetable and/or in a coma.  WIS -1 - You have no short term memory and often suffer violent mood swings. WIS -2 - You suffer from Insanity (see SANITY) WIS -3 - You are reduced to a state of gibbering unable to perceive the world around you. WIS -4 - You are confined to a cell and restrained so that you do not harm yourself. WIS -5 - You are lost.  CHA -1 - You suffer from an inability to preform even the most basic social function. CHA -2 - You suffer crippling depression and/or lash out at everything around you. CHA -3 - You withdraw completely from the world and even from yourself. CHA -4 - You are catatonic unwilling to face reality. CHA -5 - You cannot function without life-support

SKILLS

This is a large part of what makes your character unique.  A character’s skill set can ultimately determine their success or failure during a scenario.  One will never find what they are looking for without a successful Investigation check.  One will never peacefully haggle a price without Persuasion.  One will not come out of a bar fight without Brawl.  These Skills are an extension of your POCC/SOCC and your character’s personality.   Choose them wisely but at the same time keep your character in mind.  You are not playing to win the mainipulate-the-skill-tree game, you are RPing your character.  Do you have useless skills? I know I do, maybe your character has her fair share as well.

Much like the STATS, SKILLS are purchased in the same manor, however you will always have to buy your first point in a skill.

lv1 - 1 point  lv2 - 2 points lv3 - 3 points lv4 - 4 points lv5 - 5 points

If you want to raise a SKILL up to lv5 you will need to spend 15 points.


 MERITS and FLAWS  You can take up to 3 Merits and 3 Flaws at character creation. Additional Merits or Flaws may be purchased at the GM's discretion. Merits are a very special skill that allows you a unique feat. Merits cost points. Flaws however are... well, flaws of your character. For each flaw you take you gain points to spend. So the more you take the more you have to spend. You just have to remember, a Flaw taken is a flaw that must be played. Do not take a Flaw if you do not plan on using it with your character. Also be warned that a good GM will make use of your Merits and Flaws, sometimes to your advantage and sometimes to your disadvantage.  Once your character reaches its first level you begin to earn "Merit" points along with your XP . These merit points can increase and decrease depending on your actions during a level. Not necessarily "good or bad" actions, just over all performance. 1-2 merit points can be rewarded each level, which can be saved to purchase new merits. Things such as proper roleplaying, behavior during campaign, and staying true to your character can earn points. 1-2 merit points can also be taken away at the GM's discretion. Things such as meta gaming, poor attitude towards other players, and purposeful sabotage can lead to loss of points. 
EQUIPMENT
There are many types of Equipment in the game. From everyday clothing to Tactical Ballistic Nuclear missiles you can fly through a door 1000 miles away without ever touching the frame. Most simple equipment is assumed to be on your character. Everyday clothing, watches, pens, paper, cell phone (basic) and stuff are a given, but include them regardless to ensure there is no question when the time comes to use them.


APPEARANCE/BACKGROUND
What do you look like?  Who are you and what do you do? What motivates you? Why are you here? What is a memorable moment from your past that defines you? These are just a few of the questions your characters can ask themselves to sew all the threads of the character sheet together.

CHARACTER CREATION pt05  EQUIPMENT All equipment has one thing in common, a DC. The DC is the Damage Capacity of an item, or in other words how much damage an item can sustain before breaking. Most everyday items have a DC of .5 or 1 meaning if they are damaged for equal to or greater then they are destroyed.   ex. You pick up a vase with a DC of .5/1. This means you have to do over .5 damage to affect it. The "1" stands for the items pseudo HP. Say your character has a STR of 3. This will cause a base damage of 3 to the vase. So throwing it against the wall with only STR will reduce it a fine powder. If the player happens to have "Weapon Spec Throwing" she could transform the once harmless vase into a projectile that would do real damage to something (without the WS Throw you only do half your STR damage) If you do damage double the DC of an item you take two points from it instead of one. If you do triple item is instantly destroyed no matter how many points it has left. 
Armor has a DC like everything else but it also has something called SOAK. Armor is naturally designed to protect you from damage. So only the damage that goes over the soak number actually counts toward the DC and harming your character.   ex. Carmalita has a bulletproof vest on. This has a DC of 5/3 and a SOAK of 3. She has cornered a Rebel traitor at the end of an alley. Unknown to her he is packing a 12g Shotgun. The 12g Shotgun does 5 damage a shot as a base. (in this example I am purposefully leaving out combat rolls to make it simpler) The squirrel fires hitting Carmalita in the chest. The SOAK takes the first 3 damage from the shot leaving Carmalita to take the remaining 2. The damage was equal to the Vest’s DC and takes a point off reducing the vest from 5/3 to 5/2.  
Weapons have a DC as everything else. But the main feature of weapons is the addition of a stat and skill. Ranged weapons have three ranges, */*/* the first range has no penalties, the second range has a -1 to hit, and the third has a -3, after that it is a -5 to hit. All range is calculated in yards.  To hit a Plush with a Melee weapon it is STR+Melee vs DEX (+any skill that that counters ie dodge/parry etc)  To hit a Plush with a Ranged weapon it is DEX+Ranged(Firearms, Archery) vs DEX(+any skill that that counters ie dodge/parry etc)  To hit a Plush with a Thrown weapon it is STR+Thrown vs DEX(+any skill that that counters ie dodge/parry etc) To block an incoming attack its STR+Block(or equivalent)  High ground is +1 to all attacks Low ground is -1 to all attacks  Dual wielding weapons of any kind gives you a -4 to hit on your off hand. Ambidex will remove this penalty. Dual wielding melee weapons requires you to have Ambidex.   Called Shots -2 Arms and Legs -4 Joints (disable) -4 Head Shot  Run & Gun -3 to hit if you are on the run, every 2 points in Athletics lowers this by 1  Cover Partial -1 to hit, +1 to atk Half -	2 to hit, +1 to atk Full - 	Cannot be hit  Drive -4 to shoot & Drive, each point in drive lowers this by 1  AIM +1 to hit if you spend the entire rnd aiming, an additional point is gained for every rnd spent aiming after (max +5)  Effects Daze -3 to hit Knocked Down -2 to hit

Character Creation pt06  Psionics and Magics  Psionics are based off two stats, INT and WIS. These are rolled to activate a stat. The higher the number the better the result. Psi powers come in 3 different types. Mind, Physical, Energy. You can only specialize in one type. Psi powers are unique in the fact that they, unlike spells are usually available almost instantly. Normally no concentration check is needed to activate a Psi skill. But if you are under a stressful situation or in combat you will need to roll your Concentration (skill) + your Wis (stat). This number competes against what ever is being dealt against you.  ex. Rahs'Akari is using her telekinesis to knock her attacker off his feet. This is a check against the attackers STR+INT (4+2 = 6). Her check is Conc + WIS (3+4 = 7) she succeeds by a narrow margin knocking him off balance.   The more of a lead you get on a check the greater the result. If the check is twice that of the others then the effect is doubled. Which leads us to the second part. Each Psi ability has 3 lvs. 1st lv being your most basic, a newly learned ability. The 2nd lv is advanced having used it enough or trained enough to use it to its potential. And the 3rd lv is considered a Super class, and is rarely reached. At 3rd lv the power seems almost god like to those around the Psionisist. Level progression goes as follows.  Lv 1 Psi - 6pts lv 2 Psi - 12pts lv 3 Psi - 36pts  INT needed to learn a certain level of spell  lv1 - 1-2 INT lv2 - 3-4 INT lv3 - 5 INT  Psi abilities are usable at will and only require casting time if stated in the ability. They cannot be forgotten but they can be suppressed by other Psionisists. A disadvantage to being a Psi is you are heavily persecuted. If someone even suspects you of being a Psi you will be singled out and carted away, not just by the military or local law enforcement. In fact your a shade better off with them, innocent people lynch, the law prosecutes then kills you. So even though you may have many wondrous powers be wary of using them. Using abilities does come at a cost. Psi users also hate each other and have a great mistrust of their fellow Plush. When there are more then one Psi with in 10 feet of one another they create a sort of Psi spike that can be detected by another Psi from a great distance. This detection is usually made by the Broken Circle Psi hunters who are always on the prowl. Hence when a Psi sees another they either run in opposite directions or kill one another so that there is no spike to be traced. Also when Psi are near each other they leave a small residual "mind stain" on each other's conscious that can be followed back like a chain from Psi to Psi to Psi. This makes it very bad for Psi's who have been in contact with other Psi's because a Hunter can now determine who the other Psi is and find them. There are no Psi factions as they have a great distrust for one another. Only 1 critter in 1 million has Psi abilities. Though that number has been significantly reduced by Brown. At any given time there are less then 400 Psi users on a planet of 3.5 billion critters. 370 of which want nothing to do with each other.  You can use as many Psi levels as you have WIS+Concentration. For each round you have said skill activated you lose that many levels. Hence if you have a lv3 Psi ability activated for 3 rnds you lost 9 caster levels. If you go over you loose 1 HP for every level you went over during the cast. This can be avoided by simply resting 2 rnds out of combat. In combat it takes 4 rnds of rest to reset the spell levels.  MIND  Alter Aura -		(make your alignment seem other then it is) Astral Projection -	(Slip into a dream state and enter the astral plane) Battle Mind -		(+2/lv to all atks) Clairaudience -	(commune with spirits) Clairvoyance -		(see the unseen) Data Link -		(uplink to comp with your mind) Empathy -		(feel what others around you feel) Induce Feeling -	(impart an emotion upon target) Illusion -		(create a figment) Mind Wipe -		(wipe a memory from target or self) Mind Read -		(read minds unguarded) Mind Shield -		(Shield one's own mind) Navi-cognition -	(find the path) Pre-cognition -	(see the future, must be holding object) Post-cognition -	(see the past, must be holding object) Resist -		(resist commands/temptations/etc) See Aura/Appearance (see through illusions, disguises, detect alignment) Sixth Sense -		(+2/lv to all DEX checks (not +2DEX)) Suggest -		(impart a simple command into someone's mind, cannot command to kill) Telepathy -		(speak through your mind)  PHYSICAL  Death Trance -	(put self into a death like state, slow body functions) Force Barrier -		(impenetrable barrier, 1lv 3' diameter - 2lv 10' dia - 3lv 50' dia) Improved STAT -	(up one STAT by 2 for 1rnd/lv) Incorporeal Form -	(pass through matter, 1lv max 1', 2lv max 10', lv3 100') Levitation -		(lift yourself with your mind, 1lv 5rnds normal speed, 2lv 10rnds sprint speed, 3lv  x2 sprint) Resist Element -	(resist specified element, 1lv 75% dmg, 2lv 50% dmg, lv3 25% dmg) Summon Inner Will -	(temp hp, lv1 +2hp, lv2 +3hp, lv3 +4hp)  Teleforce -		(push/crush objects with your mind, lv1 500psi, lv2 1500psi, lv3 3000psi) Telekintetics -		(lift objects with your mind, lv1 0-20lbs, lv2 20-100lbs, lv3 100-1000lbs) Telemechanics -	(fix things with your mind)  ENERGY  Displacement -	(warp the world around you 1lv -2 to hit you, 2lv -4, lv3 -8) Electrokinetics -	(blast target with electricity, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg) Hydrokinetics -	(blast target with water pulled from around you, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg) Mind Blast -		(blast target with your mind, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg, target has to make a STR check or be knocked down) Photokinetics -	(blast target with light, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg, CON check or blinded) Pyrokinetics -		(blast target with fire, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg) Psycokinetics -	(scramble targets mind, 1lv 3dmg - 2lv 6dmg - 3lv 12dmg, INT check or target is crippled with fear) Psi Weapon (melee) -	(able to form a weapon out of energy, 1lv 3dmg, 2lv 6dmg cuts through soft metals, 3lv 12dmg cuts through most metals) Psi Weapon (ranged) -	(able to project a golf ball sized ball of energy at high speeds 1lv 2dmg - 2lv 4dmg - 3lv 8dmg) Total Recall -		(perfect recall of a situation 1lv max 3days, 2lv max 2 weeks, 3lv 1 month)   MAGICS  The magic system is relatively the same as the Psi system. Here however you use your INT+Concentration to learn a spell and your CHA+Concentration to cast it. Here is where magic branches off considerably from Psi. Magic is composed of 5 schools. Elemental, Divine, Illusion, Summoning, and Enchanting. A magician can choose only one school at first. Later in life if she has studied enough they may choose a second school. Their second school however will never be as strong as their primary and is limited to 3rd level spells. Which brings us to spell level. There are 5 levels for each class. Each level takes learning to advance to and the proper spell books. You cannot advance to another level by points alone. You must have the appropriate spellbook/scroll to learn from. Casting spells does come at a cost. You can cast as many spell levels as you have INT+Concentration. If you go over you loose 1 HP for every level you went over during the cast. This can be avoided by simply resting 2 rnds out of combat. In combat it takes 4 rnds of rest to reset the spell levels.  ex. Rahs'Akari has INT 4 and Concentration 3, which gives her 7 casting levels. She casts one 1st level spell and two 2nd level spells. This adds up to 5 levels worth of spells cast. 7 - 5 = 2. She now only has 2 levels of spells left before she has to rest a round or two to recharge. But the enemy has just released a few more troops. She can either cast a lv2 spell in hopes to scare them and not go over or she can obliterate them with a lv3 spell. She chooses the latter. Casting the 3rd level spell she turns the enemy to vapor. But 7 - 5 - 3 = -1. She has went over her casting level and has now lost a hit point. Constant spell effects drain that equal number of spell levels per rnd as the level of the spell being cast.  level cost  lv1 - 4 lv2 - 8 lv3 - 16 lv4 - 32 lv5 - 64  INT needed to learn a certain level is equal to level being learned. ie to learn a lv3 spell you need 3 INT  casting time (can vary depending on school)  lv1 - 1rnd lv2 - 2rnds lv3 - 2rnds lv4 - 3rnds lv5 - 5rnds  Spells unlike Psi abilities all take time to cast. The higher the level the longer the cast the more powerful the spell. Schools are broken up as follows. You can substitute spells, the ones currently there are to give you a template. You can follow the template or create your own.  ELEMENTAL (lv1 single (2dmg) - lv2 multi (3dmg 10'cone)- lv3 AOE (5dmg 20') - lv4 storm (10dmg 50') - lv5 special)  -Fire (Fire Bolt - Flame Spray - Fireball - Fire Storm - Meteor Shower (25dmg 200')  -Water (Ice Bolt - Cone-o-cold - Frost Nova (Dex check or frozen) - Hail Storm - Blizzard (15dm 200' DEX+CON vs caster CHA+Conc or frozen)   -Air (Static - Lightning Bolt - Chain Lightning (+5' for close critters) - Tornado (DEX vs cast CHA or knocked down) - Hurricane (20dmg 200')  -Earth - (Stone - Gravel Spray - Tremor (DEX vs castCHA or knock dwn) -  Earthquake 5R (buildings suffer 20DC dmg and everyone is knocked down) - Earthquake 9R (buildings suffer 50DC dmg and everyone is knocked down 15dmg 200')  DIVINE (lv1 single (2dmg) - lv2 multi (3dmg 10'cone)- lv3 AOE (5dmg 20') - lv4 storm (10dmg 50') - lv5 special)  -Dark (Shadow Bolt - Constricting Darkness - Shadow Ball - Shadow Rift - Dark Triad (INT vs castCHA or become incapacitated 15dmg 200')  -Light (Shining Arrow - Prismatic Spray - Flash (CON vs cast CHA or blinded) - Holy Wrath - Divine Judgment (20dmg 200' evil align takes an extra +5)  -Healing (not available)  ILLUSION (lv1 simple - lv2 complex - lv3 quasi real - lv4 mass AOE - 5 special)  -Mental -Physical -Lucid  SUMMONING (lv 1 simple - lv2 large - lv3 Dire - lv4 Greater - lv5 Elder)  -Animal -Monster -Fiend -Elemental -Request (summon willing party members) (1 member 1 mile - 1 memb 5 miles - 2 memb 1 mile - 2 members 10 miles - 3 members 50 miles)  ENCHANTING   -Imbue Item (level = level of spell able to attach for rnds (4-4-3-2-1)  -Permanency (level = level of spell able to make perm (usually needs Imbue Item as well)  -Conjuration (ex. lv1 water for 5 Plush - lv2 bread for 5 Plush - lv3 meals for 10 Plush - lv4 hearty meal for 20 Plush - lv5 food to feed 100 Plush)  -Curse -Runes  As with Psi, Magicians have a disadvantage, you are heavily persecuted. If someone even suspects you of being a Magician you will be singled out and carted away, not just by the military or local law enforcement. In fact your a shade better off with them, innocent people lynch, the law persecutes then kills you. So even though you may have many wondrous powers be wary of using them. Mages hate each other for relatively the same fact Psi users do. To many of them in the same location creates a Magic Spike that is detectable to even the most untrained magician. Though where Psi may just agree to part company and give each other space, a magician will almost always try to kill her fellow critter. Mostly for the sacred book of spells every magician keeps on them. Also the more one uses magic the more of a spike one creates. Even a single wizard can create a spike strong enough to be detected round the world if they cast to many high level spells. The Hunters are always out there looking for them to slip up. Generally you will not find more the two magicians in a group. Where as there are no factions with the Psi, Magicians have one. Libriati Arcanum. This is their entire collected work from the moment a Magian could scribe. Millennia's worth of knowledge is stored there. All Magicians, no matter good or corrupt respect the Archives more then their own lives. Its locations is unknown but said not to be even on this plane anymore. The secret was taken from the Magicians as Brown wiped them out. 1 in 1 million critters is able to use magic. Brown has seen fit to reduce their numbers to 200 within a world of 3.5 billion people. 5 of which are able to cast over lv3 spells. The others are barely in training.

Character Creation pt07  TABLES  SANITY (place your sanity check # here) : 0 0 0 0 0   There are five levels to sanity, represented above by 0's. As you lose sanity points your character starts to become less and less attached to the reality around them. They will begin to experience things that are "not" there and hear things unheard by the rest of the group.   Lv5 - Sanity - your character is under your complete control with no negatives. They are at their strongest mentally.   Lv4 - Paranoia - Your character begins to feel like the world is at time at odds with them. This level has a lose -1 penalty to some rolls as determined by the situation.   Lv3 - Instability - Your character begins to become unstable around others. They will often be belligerent, irrational, and will begin to see/hear things at the GM's discretion. Their past will crop up to tear away at their sanity. This level has a -2 penalty to all mental and social rolls.   Lv2 - Delirium - This is where things start to get interesting. Your character, while still under you guidance is no longer in your control. They will see/hear and experience things the group cannot. They will fight/flee with characters and imaginary objects. If they are armed they will be a danger to themselves and others. Lv2 is the last stage a character can be "talked down". Their past will haunt them and their FLAWS will double in power. There is a -3 penalty to all social and mental rolls. A -2 penalty is applied to negotiations with a lv2 character.   Lv1 - Insanity - Characters are no longer in their players control. They will act of their own volition based upon their history, alignment, stats, and abilities. They will not see situations for what they are rather they will irrationally view the world from an extremely warped perspective. Their temperament is based upon their alignment/personality before succumbing to insanity. Good, will often lead to cataonic/fleeing, while evil will manifest itself in the most psychotic of ways.   Recovery time: Lv4 - A days rest or reassurance of the state of reality. Lv3 - 2 days rest and minor counseling. Medication is optional. Lv2 - Confinement and counseling. Medication is recommended but not required.  Lv1 - Confinement, restraint, counseling, medication, and alternative methods of psychotherapy.   Losing Sanity Points:  Sanity check # = (SANITY + WIS + Concentration + (points from Merits) - (Flaws + penalties))  Checks against sanity, a situation and character background will determine the true score, this is more of a Rule of Thumb in order to get a base in which to build off of.  1-5 - Surprises, scares, horror movies, your fears 6-8 - Peaceful death of a relative 9-11 - Death of a close relative/friend 12-13 - Death of a family member | ghost 14-15 - eye witness to a violent death | violent poltergeist 16-17 - eye witness to the death of a family member | vampire true form 18-19 - witness/victim of a massacre | victim of possession 20 - Death of your family | Supernatural horror 21+ - Supernatural  Fo example, using Carmalita from the character sheet example, a check against your sanity goes as follows -  Sanity Check 5 = (5 + 1WIS) - (-1Unlucky).   Carmalita stumbles into an alley where she has cornered a serial kidnapper. He holds five children at gun point, before she can even move he executes one on the spot. Stuffing and brain matter splatter her and Carmalita recoils in horror. She is accustomed to death in her line of work but has a child of her own so this resonates with her.   [Taking in to account her job, and the situation, a normal check of 14 for an eye witness to a violent death is dropped to 7, but since she has a child of her own at home we will add an additional point against her giving us 8. Now in order to calculate whether or not she lost a sanity point divide the total by 3 and subtract 1. The resulting number is the loss or even gain of sanity points (note that you can only gain back points in lv3-5 this way). In short: 8-5=3 >> 3/3=1 >> 1-1=0 ((check-SANITY)/3)-1 = SANITY Loss/Gain]  Carmalita recovers, uses Quick Draw and puts a .45 round between his eyes. Believing it is all over Carmalita holsters her weapon and ushers the children out of the alley amidst sirens. As she turns to leave a hand grasps her ankle. Carmalita spins and uses Quick Draw again to put a round into the body behind her, only to find that it isn't the killer's hand crushing her ankle, it is the head less child. Black fluid flows from the gaping wound in its skull as its eyes swing like pendulums from its sockets. "Take me home mommy." it gurgles and begins to crawl up her leg.   [Carmalita has no prior experience with the supernatural and since she already resonates with children the check this time will be 16. 16-5=11 >> 11/3=3.6(always round down) >> 3-1=2]  Carmalita loses 2 points of sanity on the spot. In her sudden panic she fires blindly at the horror. Two rounds obliterate the remnants of the crawling horror, and a further two shatter her own leg. Carmalita falls to the ground her gun spinning from her hand as she grasps her leg in pain. Something grabs hold of her tail, through pain blurred eyes Carmalita lifts her tail to find a hand grasping the fur with an arm dangling ending in greasy black stuffing.   [Since Carmalita is now at Lv 3 her sanity check has gone from 5 to 3. If she were still mobile and weapon in hand she may have caused herself more harm, but since she is wounded and weaponless we can say she passes out due to mental and physical shock.]   ===	===	===   COLD BLOODED   Table for calculating cold-blooded effects on Reptiles.  A reptile needs to artificially maintain body temperature. This can be done through natural means (sun, environment) or artificial (heating systems, or wetware). Should a reptile go too long without warming up they will begin to suffer penalties and eventually coma or death in extreme cases. Warming a reptile up takes half the time it spent cold. The Loss of Heat table works as follows. First you determine your Racial size, then you determine how long you have spent without the aid of heat (time penalties are cumulative), this result is modified further by the current temperature, should the character be trying to take action a metabolism modifier will augment the result further.  LOSS OF HEAT TABLE Size [Time penalty 8h/16h/24h/32h (CON + Survival vs 5 Coma)] (temp modifiers 50F/10C, 30F/-1C, 10F/-12, 0F/-17C) (metabolism modifer/rnd)
 Small [-1 all checks/-3 all checks/-1HP/-3HP Coma] (0/-3/-5/-7) (0/0/-1/-1) Medium [-0 all checks/-1 all checks/-3 all checks/-3HP Coma] (0/-1/-3/-5) (0/-1/-3/-5) Large [-0 all checks/-1 all checks/-3 all checks/-1HP] (0/-1/-3/-5) (-1/-3/-5/-7)  For example:
 Gillian the snake’s synthetic warming skin has run out of batteries halfway through his mission to track down a Rebel Base located in the far north. It is near freezing out and he cannot risk being left out in the cold for too long. Gillian slithers with determination to reach his goal. Eight hours later he has the base in sight in a small valley, but he is still hours out and beginning to feel the effects. Gillian must roll his first Loss of Heat check (-1 to all checks).   [Medium Plush at 8h is 0, the temp modifier 30F/-1C is -1, metabolism modifier is mild since he is just moving 0]  He is still feeling fine but struggles with the deep snow and makes poor time. Another 8 hours pass before he can make it to the Rebel Base perimeter, here he must make a second check (-3 to all checks)  [Medium Plush at 16h is -2 (cumulative), the temp modifier 30F/-1C is -1, metabolism modifier is mild since he is still just moving 0]  Just as he is about to slip into a building he hears the crunch of snow behind him.   [Gillian fails a spot check due to his condition]  However he is quick and strikes with accuracy at the Fox who stumbled upon him. Wrapping his body around the rebel Gillian uses Constrict to silence him and begin to crush the life from his foe. But his condition makes the effort difficult. Gillian must make another check since his metabolism is working overtime to kill his foe. He knows it will take him three rounds to knock the Fox unconscious but is uncertain he will last past two. (-3, -4, -6)  [Medium Plush at 16h is -2 (cumulative), the temp modifier 30F/-1C is -1, metabolism modifier/rnd 0, -1, -3]  On the third round the Fox breaks free of the constriction but not without his share of broken bones. Instead of fighting the Fox limps away shouting. Gillian decides to slip into the building and hide in order to warm himself into a fighting form.   ===	===	===  POISON/VENOM TABLE Based off ability to deliver volume of Poison/Venom (ie small plush can't deliver the same volume as large). Damage can be augmented by "Concentrated Poison/Venom" Merit. Each level, Mild, Strong, Deadly needs the previous as a Pre Req.   Poison is ALWAYS Absorbed or Ingested Venom is ALWAYS Injected  Size - MERIT : DMG/RND S - Mild (-6) : -1/-1/-1 S - Strong (-8) : -2/-1/-1/ S - Deadly (-10) : -2/-2/-1/ M - Mild (-6) : -1/-1/-1/-1 M - Strong (-8) : -2/-1/-1/-1 M - Deadly (-10) : -2/-2/-1/-1/ L - Mild (-6) : -1/-1/-1/-1/-1 L - Strong (-8) : -2/-1/-1/-1/-1 L - Deadly (-10) : -2/-2/-1/-1/-1

Gillian, now warmed up and rested sets out to find the rebel commander.  With his Thermal Vision and natural ability to slither through the ducting and tight places of the base he finds the commander easily.  A large ox as thick as any oak, Gillian knows he must strike first if he wants to take down the ox.  From an overhead vent Gillian drops onto the ox and strikes with a surprise attack.  Gillian is a Viper so he is a Medium sized Plush, but he only has a Mild venom.

Character Creation pt08  Vehicles  DRIVE  With each point that is added to this ability the more wheeled vehicles are suddenly open to your control. Each vehicle is broken up into parts to better represent the skill involved with its operation and the attributes of the vehicle itself.  First you will see the name/type of the vehicle followed immediately by the Drive score required to operate. If you operate a vehicle without the drive score noted you will do so at -2 per point, i.e., if you have a Drive score of 2 and plan to jump into a Construction Crane(4) all of your checks concerning the Crane will be made with a -4 penalty. Conversely for every point over the Drive score required you receive a +1 to all your checks. In other words, if you have Drive(5) and jump into a Hatchback (listed below) you can drive it on two wheels while mooning your opponent.   Second you will see the main body that represents the vehicle’s attributes. Acceleration is the number of RNDs it takes to reach the next level of speed. Speed, marked in mph, is broken into three levels. The first is the slow speed, driving through a parking lot or navigating busy streets. The second is your regular speed, driving along the open road, cruising without straining the vehicle. The third is your top speed, this is the maximum rate at which the car will travel. In order to maintain a top speed and keep the vehicle under control you must have a Drive skill one point greater than the listed requirement. Power is the basic representation of Horsepower and Torque. Before you car nuts write me angry emails, yes I know they are separate, but for ease of use they are mashed together for a simple Power rating; in short, the more Power you have, the faster you go or the more you can pull. Range is the maximum distance a vehicle can travel on a full tank, roughly it is broken down by 10s. So a range of 2 = 20 miles, a range of 10 = 100 and so on.   Finally we come to our well known DC. It works the same as DC always has but here you will notice the vehicles have a few more capacity points than most objects. This gives them a pseudo HP. If a vehicle’s points are reduced by half it is rendered inoperable but it can still be repaired. If the points are depleted the vehicle is destroyed completely. Speed Damage tables below.

===	===	===  So, in short,  Carmalita has Drive(1), she is not a patrol officer nor does she normally get involved with high speed pursuits. She is a detective and drives around a beat up old sedan. While driving her Sedan(1) - (2:15/50/80:2/40) - DC 3/10 she spots her quarry, a teenage songbird exiting a shop. She begins to pull over to stop the suspect for questioning when the songbird takes to the air. Carmalita steps on the gas and throws on her siren and light.   [Carmalita will need 2 rounds before she can progress to the second level of speed.]  The songbird flies down an alley and Camalita turns in to follow.   [A drive check (difficulty 3 + car score 1 = 4) is required for the maneuver, Camalita’s Dex+Drive 4]  She keeps control of her car but scrapes the wall in pursuit. The songbird goes up and over a building and Carmalita loses sight of it. Looking up she does not see the exit of the alley and shoots into the street. Distracted she does not see the parked car ahead of her.  [A drive check of (4) is required to miss it, Dex+Drive 4 -1 for the distraction = 3]  Carmalita clips the parked car hard tearing its bumper off but spots the songbird in the air and continues turning down the street.  [Using the Damage/Speed table below her car suffers only cosmetic damage reducing its capacity by 2]  Carmalita finds herself driving the wrong way on a oneway street.  [A drive check of (5) is required to dodge oncoming traffic, Dex+Drive 4]  Carmalita clips, and sideswipes many oncoming cars but manages to avoid smashing headlong into them.  [Reduces her car by another 2]  Camalita spots the songbird landing on a rooftop and comes screeching to a halt on a side street. She steps out of the car only to see a grenade bounce off the hood of her car.

 SPEED DAMAGE Damage due to vehicles colliding into objects is calculated first by the two DC’s of the opposing forces. The losing vehicle takes the initial damage. Speed is the second factor and is calculated after and transferred equally to both vehicles. Striking vehicle vs Opposing vehicle.   Super Car vs Tank : DC 2 - DC 7 = -5 Super car takes 5 dmg right off the bat. Speed damage is transferred to both vehicles, lets say the Super car was doing 90, from the table below that is 9 dmg to both vehicles. The tank with its armor shrugs off all but 2 points of damage. The Super Car however takes 12 total damage and is reduced to a fiery ball of expense.  Front End Loader vs Sports Car : DC 4 - DC 3 = 1 Sports Car takes 1 dmg right off the bat. The Loader is only doing 10mph, however since the Loader is substantially larger H vs M a size multiplier is used. The Huge multiplier is 6 vs the Medium Multiplier of 2. We subtract these to get a base multiplier of 4. The Sports Car takes a second point of dmg. (This is assuming we only drive over the car and not smash or flip it with the loader bucket).  Lawnmower vs Lawnmower : DC 2 - DC 2 = 0 The Lawnmowers are a match of metal. They come at each other with a blinding speed of 5mph so we will use 10 (always round up). Both are S so no multipliers are used and the DC of each shrug of the 1 dmg. We witness maybe some cracked plastic or scratched paint but no more.  Sports Car vs Plush : DC 3 - Plush (a Plush has no natural DC and is considered 0. If a Plush is wearing armor, they can use half their armor’s DC. If they have natural SOAK they may use that as their DC. We will assume this Plush has neither). The Plush takes 3 dmg right off the bat. The car is doing 30 so it has a bas dmg of 3. The Plush in question is a M sized cat, the Car is also M size. Using the table below Car 4 - Plush 2 = 2. The Plush is hit with 6 dmg worth of speed plus the initial 3 giving the total potential dmg of 9. However, the Plush is not without defense. She will only take the full 9 dmg is she is caught flat footed or surprised, should she be aware of the hit she can use DEX + Dodge/Athletics to try to avoid or reduce the dmg.   SPEED DAMAGE TABLE: Speed : DMG : Vehicle Size Multiplier (S/M/L/H/G) : Plush Size Multiplier (S/M/L) 10 : (1) (0/2/4/6/8) : (0/2/4) 30 : (3) (0/2/4/6/8) : (0/2/4) 50 : (5) (2/4/6/8/10) : (0/0/2) 70 : (7) (2/4/6/8/10) : (0/0/0) 90 : (9) (4/6/8/10/12) : (0/0/0) 110 : (11) (4/6/8/10/12) (0/0/0)
